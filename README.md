## 📝 Adding Blog Posts

Create Markdown files in the `posts/` directory:

```markdown
---
title: 'Your Awesome Blog Post'
date: '2024-01-15'
excerpt: 'A brief description of your post'
author: 'Your Name'
---

Your blog content here with **Markdown** support!

### Code Example

\`\`\`javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
\`\`\`
```

Blog posts automatically appear on the `/blog` page.

## 🎨 Customizing Styles

The portfolio uses Tailwind CSS. Customize theme in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#your-color',
        secondary: '#your-color',
        // Add your custom colors
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## 📧 Setting Up the Contact Form

The contact form uses Gmail SMTP. Here's how to set it up:

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification

1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable [2-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/security)

### Step 2: Generate App Password

1. Visit [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
3. Copy the 16-digit password

### Step 3: Add to Environment Variables

```env
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-digit-app-password
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/g1mishra/nextfolio)

**Manual deployment:**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import repository in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

### Deploy to Netlify

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `.next`
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy!

### Other Platforms

Compatible with any Next.js hosting:

## 🎯 Customization Tips

### Changing Colors

Edit `styles/globals.css` or `tailwind.config.js` to change the color scheme.

### Adding New Pages

Create new routes in the `app/` directory following Next.js 13 conventions.

### Modifying Components

All components are in the `components/` directory. They're well-organized by feature.

### Adding Projects

Projects can be added through:

1. MongoDB (configure in `.env.local`)
2. Directly in code (modify `lib/projects.ts`)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

The default port is 3001. If it's in use, change it in `package.json`:

```json
"dev": "next dev -p 3002"
```

### Email Not Sending

- Verify Gmail credentials in `.env.local`
- Check if 2-Step Verification is enabled
- Ensure App Password is correct (not your regular password)

### Icons Not Showing

- Verify internet connection (Devicon loads from CDN)
- Check icon class names at [devicon.dev](https://devicon.dev/)
